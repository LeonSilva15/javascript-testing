# Best Practices for JavaScript Testing

## Write Clear and Concise Tests
Ensure that each test case is focused and tests a single functionality or aspect of the code.
Use descriptive test names to make the purpose of each test clear.
Use Mocks and Stubs Appropriately

Mock dependencies to isolate the unit of code being tested.
Use stubs to control the behavior of functions that are not the primary focus of the test.

## Automate Testing
Integrate testing into the development workflow using Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions.
Run tests automatically on code commits to catch issues early.

## Maintain Test Coverage
Aim for high test coverage but prioritize testing critical and high-risk areas of the code.
Use tools like Istanbul (nyc) to measure and track test coverage.

## Write Maintainable Tests
Keep test code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by refactoring common setup or teardown code.
Organize test files and suites logically to mirror the structure of the application code.

## Test Across Multiple Environments
Ensure your application works consistently across different browsers and devices.
Use tools like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs for cross-browser testing.
