# Types of JavaScript Testing

## Unit Testing
Tests individual units or components of the JavaScript code, typically functions or methods
* **Purpose**: To ensure that each part of the code performs as intended
* **Tools**
    * Vitest
    * Jest
    * Mocha
    * Jasmine
    * QUnit

## Integration Testing
Focuses on the interaction between different units or components of the application
* **Purpose**: To verify that integrated components work together correctly
* **Tools**
    * Vitest
    * Mocha
    * Chai
    * Jest
    * Sinon

## Functional Testing
Tests the application's functionality by simulating user interactions
* **Purpose**: To ensure the software behaves as expected in real-world scenarios
* **Tools**
    * Cypress
    * TestCafe
    * Selenium

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing
Tests the complete flow of an application from start to finish
* **Purpose**: To verify that the entire application works together and meets all requirements
* **Tools**
    * Cypress
    * Puppeteer
    * Nightwatch.js

## Performance Testing
Measures the responsiveness, stability, and scalability of the JavaScript code
* **Purpose**: To ensure the application performs well under expected and peak loads
* **Tools**
    * Lighthouse
    * WebPageTest

## Regression Testing
Re-tests the application after changes to ensure existing functionality is not broken
* **Purpose**: To catch new bugs introduced by recent code changes
* **Tools**
    * Selenium
    * Cypress
    * Jest
